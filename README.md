# PoliticGAN

## Introduction

**PoliticGAN** is a dataset of K-Politicians built with electoral posters from 1960 to 2020, provided by [Do Won Kim](https://github.com/DO-WON)([Center for Political Communication](http://cpc.snu.ac.kr/)). We experimented on StyleGAN2-ADA, GANSpace, and StarGAN v2 models to inspect which neural network will be appropriate for finding facial properties that affect voters' political decision-making. Also, we find that there is lack of non-westernized facial dataset in piblic during data preparation, so this project might have significant help for who studies computer vision with multicultural values.
