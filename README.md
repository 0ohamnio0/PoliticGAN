# PoliticGAN

## Introduction

I built a dataset of K-Politician with the raw posters of election campagin between 1960 and 2020, provided by Dowon Kim, [Center for Political Communication](http://cpc.snu.ac.kr/) for the study on the image of Politicians. We experimented on StyleGAN2-ADA, GANSpace, and StarGAN v2 models to inspect which neural network will be appropriate for finding facial properties that affect voters' political decision-making. Also, we find that there is lack of non-westernized facial dataset in piblic during data preparation, so this project might have significant help for who studies computer vision with multicultural values.
